            Positioned slightly away from the top of the homepage, closer to the center, the rule of thirds becomes apparent. A photo featuring cheese sticks on the left directs the viewer's gaze towards the focal pointâ€”the act of ordering pizza. Meanwhile, the restaurant logo is situated at the top left, and at the bottom, the phone number and the option to order online complete the composition.

            Visual hierarchy is evident upon entering the home page. The most popular news story claims the highest position, featuring the largest clickable link and the most prominent photo. Subsequent news stories progressively decrease in size, reflecting their diminishing importance.

            On the Amazon homepage, diverse themes of contrast are evident in the design. The use of contrasting fonts is notable, serving to establish hierarchy and emphasize more important text. Red signs strategically signal discounts, creating a visual contrast with the plain black price tags. Additionally, yellow boxed text is employed to highlight and signify the locations of buttons to press on the webpage, ensuring clarity and guiding user interaction. These deliberate contrasts contribute to an organized and visually engaging user experience on the Amazon homepage.
